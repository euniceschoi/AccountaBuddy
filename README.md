#AccountaBuddy
A social media platform that allows users to connect through shared goals. Users can find others via geolocation and category of the goal they are trying to achieve

Accountabuddy is a 1-week long capstone project built on a Ruby on Rails framework, PostgreSQL database, Active Record, Foundation and used several API's including: Mapbox & Facebook


> One of the biggest reasons why many of us tend to lose motivation in keeping up with our goals is because we have a hard time keeping ourselves accountable. Accountabuddy is a solution to actually lose that 10 pounds, to quit smoking, or to keep up with vegetarianism. Through the web app, you can create a user profile and look for others near you who are aiming for similar goals. As your friendship grows via our chat system, you can choose to become accountabuddies. The accountabuddy relationship is special in that you can write each other endorsements that show up on your page and give each other badge points. Feel free to explore!
